## Project Title

Side Quest Week 2: Panicked Blob

---

## Description

Users will see a blue, feathering blob on grey ground, with four grey platforms placed at different heights. There are instructions of how to move on the top left. The background is bright red, with capitalized "DANGER" in yellow flashing on the screen.

Users will be able to interact through moving the blob with the W/A/D keys, the arrow keys, or the space key. They will be able to move around, jump, and land on the platforms. The controls will be slippery and difficult due to the blob panicking.

The inspiration behind this design includes emergency signals/alarms, with their lights flashing or siren beeping at certain frequencies.

## Interaction Instructions

The game starts immediately when the sketch loads in. Users can use the W or space key to jump, A or left arrow key to move left, and D or right arrow key to move right.

The blob will move along with the user's keyboard inputs.
